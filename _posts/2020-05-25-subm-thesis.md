Finally, I made it to submit my PhD thesis "_Active Subspaces in Bayesian Inverse Problems_".

The thesis is now going to be reviewed by two reviewers.
If the reviews are then accepted by the department, we can conduct the defense which is the final major step to graduation.

EDIT: A final version of the thesis is available at the [TUM University library](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/?id=1546065).
