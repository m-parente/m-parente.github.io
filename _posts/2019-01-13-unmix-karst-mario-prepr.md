abstract: "In this article, we perform a parameter study for a recently developed model in karst hydrology. The study consists of a high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem and a global sensitivity analysis. For the first time in karst hydrology. we use the active subspace method to find directions in the parameter space that drive the update from the prior to the posterior distribution in order to effectively reduce the dimension of the problem and for computational efficiency. Additionally, the calculated active subspace can be exploited to construct sensitivity metrics on each of the individual parameters. The model consists of 21 parameters to reproduce the hydrological behavior of spring discharge in a karst aquifer located in the Kerschbaum spring recharge area at Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs in Austria. The experimental spatial and time series data for the inference process were collected by the water works in Waidhofen. We show that this particular real world scenario has implicit low-dimensionality, and we run an adjusted Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a low-dimensional subspace to construct samples of the posterior distribution. The results are visualized and verified by plots of the posterior's push-forward distribution displaying the uncertainty in predicting discharge values due to the experimental noise in the data. Finally, a discussion provides hydrological interpretation of these results for the Kerschbaum area."

The UNMIX project (see post [here]({% link _posts/2018-03-08-kickoff-unmix.md %})) has a next preprint available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03283).

For the last couple of months, _Daniel Bittner_, _Steven Mattis_, _Barbara Wohlmuth_, _Gabriele Chiogna_ and I worked intensively on a parameter study of a karst aquifer model modeling discharge behavior of the Kerschbaum spring in Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs.
We again exploit the active subspace method for both, a low-dimensional approach to a corresponding Bayesian inverse problem and a global sensitivity analysis.

I want to thank all contributors for their efforts in preparing and discussing this preprint!
