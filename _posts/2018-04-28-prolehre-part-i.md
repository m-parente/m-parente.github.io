title: ProLehre compact course, part I
date: 2018-04-28

I spent the last one and a half days in Herrsching near Munich together with a motivated group of PhD candidates to attend the first part of the ProLehre compact course (see [here]({% link _posts/2018-03-21-kickoff-prolehre.md %}) for the kickoff post).

The topic was __concepts for teaching and learning__. The special fact about the whole course is that it is focused on teaching in mathematics.

We learned about formulating aims in teaching maths with the so-called __adapted taxonomy for mathematics__ designed by Rudolf Aichner and Dr. Emil Ratko-Dehnert (both [ProLehre](https:www.prolehre.tum.de)) which were both giving the course together with their colleague Dr. Vanessa Krummeck from the TUM math department.

How to create a certain dramaturgy in a class with the __ARIVA__ approach was also topic of our discussions, as well as discussing within small groups how to overcome one's personal challenges in class.

In summary, I really enjoyed the time being there and exchanging opinions and ideas with my colleagues being in similar situations like me. Thanks to all of them!
