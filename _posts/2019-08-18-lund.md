From August 12th to August 28th, I am visiting the Department of Statistics at Lund University once again.
_Prof. Krzysztof Podg√≥rski_ and _Jonas Wallin_ are supporting me and my research on the theory of _active subspaces_.

Although the weather is quite rainy, I was able to get a feeling for the city and its inhabitants. Many thanks to Krzysztof, Jonas, and all university affiliates I had contact to for having me here in Lund and for making the environment to work in very smoothly!

P.S. The picture shows a path at the Botanical Garden in Lund.
It was really nice to walk there after work!
