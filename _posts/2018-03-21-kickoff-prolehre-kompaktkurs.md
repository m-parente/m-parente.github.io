title: Kickoff for ProLehre compact course at MA
---
It is a great pleasure for me to be able to announce the kickoff for the ProLehre compact course specifically for PhD students at the math department. It will take place on March 28 at [TUM Graduate School](https://gs.tum.de/) in Garching.

Rudolf Aichner ([ProLehre](https://prolehre.tum.de/)) and myself tried to find enough interested people for a teaching course during the next summer term. To my surprise, it has been a non-trivial task to convince people involved in teaching of such an event. But we did it! What is special in contrast to other ProLehre workshops in teaching, the compact course will focus on math related tasks, challenges and issues. As well, the events will be distributed over the whole summer term, and the participants will support each other in their own lectures or tutorials. Eventually, the participation will be rewarded by a certificate ([Zertifikat Hochschullehre der Bayerischen Universit√§ten - Grundstufe](https://www.prolehre.tum.de/en/angebote-zertifikate/grundstufe/)).
