My supervisor _Prof. Barbara Wohlmuth_ and I are currently joining the [Ferienakademie 2018](https://www.ferienakademie.de/) organized by __TUM,__ the __University of Stuttgart__ and the __University of Erlangen-N체rnberg__.
About 200 students are distributed among 10 courses in 5 hotels located in the Sarntal, S체dtirol.

The courses are mostly focused on technical things.
The course we have organized with _Prof. Bernd Flemisch_ and _Dennis Gl채ser_ from the University of Stuttgart covers several different topics from applied mathematics and flow in porous media.
The TUM group is working on three different subjects:
- Simulation with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)
- Image classification with (Convolutional) Neural Networks (ConvNets, CNNs)
- Bayesian Inverse Problems for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)

Among the technical subjects, the students and supervisors are having a great time in the mountains with day-filling hikes, chess and table tennis tournaments and an organized run around a nearby lake in D체rnholz.
We are accommodated in the hotel _Feldrand_ which is doing a great job providing rooms to work in productively and serving three meals and one coffee break each day.

Unfortunately, time flies by meaning that we have to leave already on Friday morning after 12 beautiful days in the Sarntal.
I am grateful to be part of this event and would like to thank each person who made this possible.
