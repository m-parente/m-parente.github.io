title: ProLehre compact course, part II
date: 2018-05-16

Last Wednesday on May 16th I attended the second part of this semester's ProLehre compact course (see [kickoff]({% link _posts/2018-03-21-kickoff-prolehre.md %}) and [part I]({% link _posts/2018-04-28-prolehre-part-i.md %})).

This time we spoke about __presentation and communication__ the whole day. It was Pit Forster (Forum Momentum, [forummomentum.com](http://www.forummomentum.com)) and Vanessa Krummeck (TUM), who trained us.

We not only discussed certain techniques for __breathing__ but also talked on how to __relax spontaneously__ in an exciting moment like a presentation in front of a big audience. We also practiced a lot, e.g. with __7 minute presentations__ on an arbitrarly chosen topic or standing in front of the whole group and wait until we felt ready to say __"I am here!"__.

Our trainers did a great job. They really know what they are talking about! Also, it was very funny with Pit, who has a wonderful humour talking about Pete Sampras and making silly facial expressions at the same time :).

Thanks to the group and the coaches for that exciting and productive day! Looking forward to [part III]({% link _posts/2018-06-23-prolehre-part-iii.md %})!
