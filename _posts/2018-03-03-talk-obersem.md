Yesterday, I gave a talk in our seminar at M2 about my recent research (see post [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-30-meth-hydr-act-subsp.md %})), i.e. active subspaces for Bayesian inversion in a real world inference scenario involving a methane hydrate model.

The outline was:
1. Bayesian inversion - Basics
2. Active subspaces - General
3. Active subspaces for Bayesian inversion
4. Application to a methane hydrate model
