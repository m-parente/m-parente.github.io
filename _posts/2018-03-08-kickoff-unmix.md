title: Kickoff for UNMIX
---
Our IGSSE project *Uncertainties due to boundary conditions in predicting mixing in groundwater (UNMIX)* got kicked off on March 8.

IGSSE (International Graduate School of Science and Engineering, [www.igsse.gs.tum.de](http://www.igsse.gs.tum.de)) is a graduate center at TUM where I became a member beginning this year.

Our [UNMIX project team](http://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/index.php?id=178) got a proposal funded for investigations in groundwater research and the inherent uncertainties involved. At the kickoff day, several talks of PhD students from both, hydrology and mathematics, were given to show some of the contents of next years' research. In addition, the principal investigators spoke a little bit about the environment we are going to work in.

I also presented some slides on my recent and future investigations in UQ (click on thumbnail to download).
