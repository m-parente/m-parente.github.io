My colleague Pablo Merch√°n designed a symbol for our project [UNMIX](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/index.php?id=178) which got kicked off recently (see [here]({% link _posts/2018-03-08-kickoff-unmix.md %})).

The different circles are supposed to reflect the **MIX**ing aspect, whereas the transparency of the circles should display the **UN**certainty involved.
