title: Start of lectures in summer term 2018
date: 2018-04-13
---
This week was the first in summer term 2018. Although the tutorials start only next week, I was already happy to spend some time for teaching again.

This summer I am going to take on two tutorials for [*Numerics for ODEs*](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de/bin/view/Allgemeines/NUMODE18). [Prof. Elisabeth Ullmann](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de/bin/view/M2/Allgemeines/Ullmann) is the lecturer, and [Laura Scarabosio](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de/bin/view/M2/Allgemeines/LauraScarabosio) and Lukas KÃ¶stler are going to be the other two tutors.

Topics covered this semester are:
- interpolation (polynomial, splines)
- quadrature
- integration
	- single-step methods
	- stability / stiff problems
	- multi-step methods
- ...

There will be an exercise sheet every week. On each exercise sheet is one problem for homework, two problems to be discussed and solved in the tutorials and a quiz with some questions to puzzle.

I wish all students a nice and inspiring semester.
