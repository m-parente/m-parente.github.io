Two days ago, on Thursday, June 21st, the third part of the ProLehre compact course took place in the Math Department at Garching (see also posts for previous parts: [kickoff]({% link _posts/2018-03-21-kickoff-prolehre.md %}), [part I]({% link _posts/2018-04-28-prolehre-part-i.md %}) and [part II]({% link _posts/2018-05-16-prolehre-part-ii.md %})).

Our two teachers _Rudolf Aichner_ (ProLehre) and _Dr. Vanessa Krummeck_ (TUM) prepared a dayfilling workshop on __Testing__. The day comprised questions like
- _What is an exam?_
- _What is a __good__ exam?_
- _How can you construct good excercise sheets?_

Also, we discussed briefly what type of _legal matters_ can occur within an examination procedure.

Since all that stuff can be uninspiring to a certain degree, our teachers decided to discuss some "real world" excercises that we as participants could bring with us.
Everyone identified his example as successful or not and had also to reason on that.

In the afternoon, we were given a talk by _Dr. Christian Ludwig_ (TUM) who is a very experienced and passionate lecturer in the math department.
He gave some insight in his daily work and presented many examples of good questions for exams and excercise sheets.

Unfortunately, the next part (IV) is already the last one comprising __reflection as a teacher__ and __supervising students__.
I am looking forward to it!
