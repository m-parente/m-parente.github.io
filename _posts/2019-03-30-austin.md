From February, 10th to March, 23rd, I was staying at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) with my colleagues from the hydrology chair at TUM.
We visited our collaborator Prof. Clint Dawson and his computational hydraulics group within the [UNMIX project]({% link _posts/2018-03-08-kickoff-unmix.md %}).
I was able to focus on my research and to talk to some PhD students from UT about their work.
It was a great time there and I really enjoyed it!
Thanks to [IGSSE](http://igsse.gs.tum.de/) making this possible with their funding for PhD students in the field of computational science and engineering!

P.S. The image shows the UT Tower built on campus.
