I am very happy to write that I finally passed my PhD defense.

The defense consisted of a 25 minutes talk on the main outcomes of my research and a subsequent oral examination on contents of the dissertation.

I want to thank the reviewers, examiners, and the chair of the examination board for their participation and interest.
