**Welcome!**

This website is supposed to contain some contents of my academic life.

My name is **Mario Teixeira Parente**. Currently, I am a PhD student at the [**Chair for Numerical Mathematics**](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de) (M2) in the [**Department of Mathematics**](https://www.ma.tum.de) of the [**Technical University Munich**](https://www.tum.de/en) (TUM).

My research interests lie in **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**, a field from applied mathematics using tools from **statistics**, **probability theory**, and **numerics**. Applications are possible wherever models are involved, be it in engineering disciplines like e.g. hydrology, in the social sciences, or physics.
